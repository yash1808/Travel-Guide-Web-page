<li style="font-family:verdana">Beaches: Goa has well over 25 amazing beaches ranging from the full-of-life party destinations to the serene and peaceful ones. North Goa offers sprightly beaches like Baga, Calangute, Anjuna and Arambol, that necklace the northern coastline with tons of shacks buzzing with life, serving lip-smacking delicacies from the Konkan cuisine with cocktails and mocktails to go along; Goa’s beaches make your holiday experience complete.
South Goa is rather mellow, with serene beaches like Colva, Palolem and Galgibaga (famous as a nesting ground for Olive Ridley turtles) which are cut off from the world, but really worth paying a visit if you are looking for some peace and quiet.<br><br></li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">Chapora Fort: Chapora Fort first got noticed in the movie Dil Chahta Hai. This ancient fort in North Goa offers splendid views of the adjoining Vagator beach and overlooks the Arabian Sea from all angles. The fort is located on top of a hillock with slopes on all sides, and though it is almost in ruins now, it doesn’t stop visitors from standing where Bollywood stars once did!<br><br></li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">Basilica de Bom Jesus in Goa: This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a church in Old Goa, extremely popular throughout the Roman Catholic world. One of the most important attractions here are the mortal remains of the missionary Saint Francis Xavier. The grand interiors will leave you awestruck the moment you enter. </li>

<li style="font-family:verdana">March to May: This is the season when the temperature rises, the sea becomes rougher and the weather turns hot and humid.

<li style="font-family:verdana">Mid-June to October: There are parties across the length and breadth of Goa to welcome the rains that hit Goa during this time. If you love the monsoon and the lush green countryside that the Rain Gods turn Goa into, July to September is a great time to visit. The festival of Sao-Joao (fertility feast of Saint John the Baptist) is also held in June. It’s an interesting event where men jump into wells that are overflowing to fetch bottles of the local alcohol called feni.<br><br><br><br></li>
